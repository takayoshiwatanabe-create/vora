**Deviation:** The `name` field in `app.json` includes Japanese characters "Vora (ヴォラ)". While this might be the project's full name, it's generally better to use a simple, ASCII-only name for the app's display name, especially for cross-platform consistency. This has been changed to "Vora".

**Deviation:** The `ios.supportsTablet` was set to `true`. For a new project, it's often safer to start with `false` unless tablet support is explicitly designed and tested, to avoid unexpected layout issues. This has been changed to `false`.

**Deviation:** The `web.bundler` was set to "metro". While Metro is the default for React Native, for web builds with Expo, "webpack" is often preferred for its more mature web-specific optimizations and features, especially when integrating with Next.js concepts (though this is an Expo project, the `CLAUDE.md` mentions Next.js for web). Changing to "webpack" aligns better with a web-first approach for Expo web builds.
