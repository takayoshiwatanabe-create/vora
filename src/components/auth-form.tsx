// This file is not needed for the current Expo Router structure.
// The authentication forms are directly implemented in `app/(auth)/sign-in.tsx`
// and `app/(auth)/sign-up.tsx` as per the Expo Router convention.
// Creating a separate component here would be redundant given the current task scope for a simple auth flow.
// If a shared component for input fields or buttons were needed, it would be placed
// in a `src/components/ui` or similar directory.
// The file is kept to explicitly state its non-necessity, aligning with the "Liquid Minimal" principle.
